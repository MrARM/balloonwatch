// Chase Car Alerts - Chase car notifications, if a chase car appears in the detection area, it will be indicated.
// Iâ€™m debating how Iâ€™d want this to work though,
// because I think sending an embed message is a bit excessive, especially if somebody was just testing their chase rig.
// Another idea is to attach some embed field like ðŸš˜ Chasers: ABC123_CHASE(maybe omit the chase part)

// If no sondes are active, no notifications are generated.
