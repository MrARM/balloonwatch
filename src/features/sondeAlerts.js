// sondeAlerts - Private alerts for nearby landings.
// You can send a command(only visible to you) to set your grid locator and a set radius.
// Balloony will alert you over DM if you are close by the landing site.
// Another idea which would likely be added as an
// optional environment variable is a webhook for the bot owner to use on a connected home.

// Will run when the balloon bursts, we will track changes in the mongodb
